# SEQ-PHRAGMEN

Seq phragmen implementation in rust

Governance need to be interoperable, whether you build on near contract, ink! or substrate.

The sequential Phragmén method is a multi-winner election method introduced by Edvard Phragmén in the 1890s

The problem that Phragmén’s methods try to solve is that of electing a set of a given numbers of persons from a larger set of candidates. Phragmén discussed this in the context of a parliamentary election in a multi-member constituency; the same problem can, of course, also occur in local elections, but also in many other situations such as electing a board or a committee in an organization.
